- name: Polynomial Expansion with Machine Learning
  descr: "Used a transformers to symbolically expand single-variable second-ordered polynomials. I deployed model as a REST API via Google App Engine. Use python math syntax e.g. c*(c-2) or 2*c**2, not (9-x)(8+x) or x*(9x-1). Performance is still being improved."

- name: Delaunay Triangulation Comparison Project
  descr: "This project idea is based on the final project of CS274 from Berkeley. File is implementation of the incremental-insertion Delaunay Triangulation algorithm found in Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams by Guibas and Stolfi; and a divide-and-conquer algorithm found in A faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for constructing delaunay triangulations by Dwyer."
