- name: Delaunay Triangulation Comparison Project
  descr: "This project idea is based on the final project of CS274 from Berkeley. File is implementation of the incremental-insertion Delaunay Triangulation algorithm found in Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams by Guibas and Stolfi; and a divide-and-conquer algorithm found in A faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for constructing delaunay triangulations by Dwyer."

- name: Sepsis Research Paper
  descr: "Developed models for papers using the MIMIC-III database. Tons of data cleaning was involved and weakening assumptions about the data was a must. Database extraction scripts are included in the database. Presented at ICHI 2018."
